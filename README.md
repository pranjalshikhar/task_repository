<ol>
  <li> <strong><i>To Explore Supervised Machine Learning - </i></strong> 
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
  </li>
  <li> <strong><i>To Explore Unsupervised Mchine Learning - </i></strong> 
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.  </li> 
<li> <strong><i>To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm - </i></strong> 
For the given 'Iris' dataset, create a decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right classifier correctly.  </li> 
<li> <strong><i>To explore Business Analytics - </i></strong> 
To Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’.  </li>
